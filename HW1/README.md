This Tic-Tac-Toe game program allows multi-player (two players) to play the game on default 3x3 grid. It uses a 2D array to represent the board and tracks the state of the game to determine the winner. Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column they want to place their symbol ('X' or 'O'). The program checks for a winner after each move by checking the rows, columns, and diagonals (left and right) for a matching sequence of symbols. If there is a winner or the board is full, the game ends, and players have the option to play again.
