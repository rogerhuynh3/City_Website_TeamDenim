            City Council consists of seven Council members. The Mayor is elected
            by the Council from its own membership. The Council exercises all of
            the legislative and policymaking powers of the City and provides for
            the performance of all duties and obligations imposed upon the City by
            law. The terms of four members of Council shall expire on the last day
            in November following each regular City election. When appointments
            are made to fill vacancies in the manner provided in the Charter,
            appointees shall qualify for and assume the duties of office within
            ten (10) days after appointment, unless such time be extended for not
            more than sixty (60) days by Council.
