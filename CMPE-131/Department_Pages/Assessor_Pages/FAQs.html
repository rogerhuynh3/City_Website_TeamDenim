        <h2>Assessor FAQs</h2>
        <h3>What types of property are assessed?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All property may be divided into two major categories: Real Property
            and Personal Property.
          </li>
          <dd>
            Real Property is generally defined as land and all things attached
            to the land. Interest, benefits, and rights inherent in the
            ownership of physical real estate.
          </dd>
          <dd>
            Personal Property which consists of movable items not permanently
            affixed to, or part of, the real estate. This includes furniture and
            fixtures, machinery and equipment belonging to a business; certain
            public utilities; structures on leased land and other similar
            properties.
          </dd>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is "Assessed Value?"</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Assessed Value is 50% of estimated fair market value which is
            determined by the City Assessor. Assessed values change with the
            market year to year. The assessor does not create value, but simply
            has the legal responsibility to determine it and value the property
            accordingly.
          </li>
          <dd>
            Assessed values change with the market year to year. The assessor
            does not create value, but simply has the legal responsibility to
            determine it and value the property accordingly.
          </dd>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is Proposal A?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In 1994 Proposal A brought significant changes to the State’s
            Property Tax System. However, Proposal A did not change standard
            assessment practices; all real and personal property must still be
            assessed at 50% of its true cash value. Proposal A created a
            different value (taxable value) for property taxes to be calculated
            on. Taxes are based on taxable value not state equalized value
            (SEV). Proposal A also requires homeowners to file a Principal
            Residence Exemption Affidavit and Property Transfer Affidavit.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is "taxable value"?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Taxable value was created by the passage of Proposal A in 1994.
            Property taxes are based on taxable value, not the SEV. Taxable
            value = Lesser of assessed value or capped value.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is "capped value"?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Capped value is the lesser of +5% or the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
            applied to prior year’s taxable value. The formula to compute is:
            (Prior year’s taxable value – losses) x (5% or CPI, whichever is
            lowest) + additions = capped value. The process continues until
            there is change in ownership (transfer) which would cause an
            “uncapping”.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is "uncapping"?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When ownership is transferred on a property, the valuation is
            “uncapped”. The SEV is the new starting point for a buyer and the
            capping process starts all over again on the property until another
            transfer of ownership occurs. Beginning December 31, 2013 (PA 497 of
            2012), the transfer of residential real property (homestead or
            non-homestead) is exempt from uncapping if the transferor by blood
            or affinity to the first degree and the use of the property does not
            change following the transfer of ownership. A change in use would be
            from principal residence to rental, which would not be exempt from
            uncapping due to a transfer. Affinity to the first degree includes
            the following relationships: spouse, father or mother, father or
            mother of spouse, son or daughter, including adopted children, son
            or daughter of spouse, and stepchildren, stepmother or stepfather.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How are property taxes calculated?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            (Taxable value/1000 x millage rate) x 1.01 (administrative fee) =
            tax amount
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          Why are my taxes different from my neighbors when our houses are the
          same?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you purchased your house in a different year than your neighbor,
            your taxable value would have been uncapped to the same as the SEV.
            Although you think your home is the same as your neighbors; there
            are many interior and exterior attributes that affect a property’s
            value such as lot size differences, year built, condition, finished
            basements, decks, number of bathrooms, etc.
