        <h3>My water bill seems high, could I have a leak?</h3>
        <p>
          Did you know that a dripping faucet can waste 207 gallons a day? Leaks
          waste water and waste your money. Take a few minutes to check for
          leaks. In the long run it will save you money. Stop the leaks! <br />
        </p>

          The City of Williamston currently averages 67lbs. of water pressure.
          The table below reflects 65lbs. of water pressure. <br />
          SIZE OF LEAK WATER WASTED IN 24 HOURS <br />
          1/32” drip 207 gallons <br />
          1/16” trickle 828 gallons <br />
          1/8” stream 1872 gallons <br />
          The smallest of these leaks will add over $575.00 to your annual water
          bill. <br />

          Toilet leaks are hard to find. They are normally caused by bad valves,
          an improperly positioned float arm or a defective overflow tube. Test
          the toilet by putting a few drops of food coloring into the back of
          the tank. DO NOT FLUSH. Let it sit as long as you can; overnight is
          best. If color appears in the toilet bowl then you have a leak and
          repairs must be made.
        </p>

          Faucet leaks are easy to detect. If it drips, or worse, continues to
          keep running after you shut if off, it needs to be fixed right away.
          If the dripping water is hot, it is also costing you extra to run the
          hot water heater.
        </p>
        <p>
          Water dripping or running from the showerhead when the shower is
          turned firmly off is usually caused by bad washers or seats, which
          need replacing. Also, check for leaks running from the tub faucet
          while the shower is on. If it is leaking, it defeats the purpose of a
          low flow showerhead because the water it should be saving with the low
          flow shower is being lost from the tub faucet.

          The DPW does not perform work/maintenance on private property, so the
          service line in your yard or parking lot, and the plumbing inside your
          home or building is the property owner’s responsibility. The DPW can
          shut the water off at the curb, but you will need to make the repairs
          yourself or consult a plumber.
