        <h2>Treasurer FAQs</h2>
        <h3>Why didn’t I receive my tax bill?</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes owner address changes aren’t received before tax bills are
          prepared. Call 517-655-2774 to resolve any incorrect information.
        </p>
        <h3>When do taxes become delinquent?</h3>
        <p>
          Unpaid property taxes go delinquent to the County Treasurer on March
          1, and additional penalties and fees are added. All questions and
          payments from then on must be handled by the Ingham County Treasurer’s
          office. Call the County Treasurer’s office at 517-676-7220 for more
          information.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What happens if I don’t pay my business “personal property” taxes?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Unpaid personal property taxes will result in a loss of that personal
          property to the local unit of government.
        </p>
        <h3>What if I think I already paid my tax bill?</h3>
        <p>
          If you have a cancelled check or receipt showing your payment, please
          call me immediately. Sometimes taxpayers overlook a summer or winter
          bill, or don’t realize they have paid late and incurred penalties.
        </p>
        <h3>My taxes are escrowed, why did I receive the tax bill?</h3>
        <p>
          This is the tax payer copy. We have also forwarded a copy to your
          Mortgage Company or financial institution if there is a number next to
          “Mort Code”. If you have recently changed lending institutions, please
          forward a copy of this statement to your tax paying agent. Your agent
          should then request further statements from our office.
        </p>
        <h3>Why didn’t I receive a copy of my paid tax receipt?</h3>
        <p>
          If you want a receipt of your tax bill, please provide a stamped
          self-addressed envelope. You may also get this information from the
          City’s website.
        </p>
        <h3>Change of property ownership – what do I do?</h3>
        <p>
          Ownership changes are recorded with the County Register of Deeds and
          then the assessor receives copies of those deeds for his/her records.
          The assessor then gives those changes to the treasurer. The treasurer
          only receives these updates a few times a year when tax bills are
          printed and mailed. Please call the assessor, Pete Preston, at
          517-655-2448 to make any needed corrections.
        </p>
