      <h2 class="history">History</h2>
      <p>
        The area that was later to become Williamston was originally the ‘summer
        home’ of a small group of the Tawas band of the Chippewa people. This
        land was used by them for planting what few crops they needed, holding
        an annual spring gathering of related bands of the tribe, and burying
        their dead. The most famous native American resident was Okemos, whose
        name survives as a postal address in nearby Meridian Township. Okemos
        means “Little Chief” in Chippewa and as in English, that phrase can mean
        either ‘physically small leader’, or ‘leader of subordinate authority’.
        It is unclear if this name was applied to Okemos because he was short,
        or because his authority was limited because he had few if any tribesmen
        below him, as both those descriptions are accurate! Unlike many native
        Americans, Okemos had a relatively well-documented life. For example, as
        an ally of the British in the War of 1812, he was so badly wounded
        during an attack on a U.S. Cavalry unit near Sandusky Ohio, that he was
        left for dead along with his cousin and all the other members of the
        attacking party. He and his cousin however did survive the attack, and
        lived on many years to recount the tale, However, Okemos bore a four to
        five-inch-long scar from a saber on the left side of his forehead the
        rest of his life as a reminder of that battle fought in his youth. Chief
        Okemos in full tribal gear, especially for the portrait, circa 1850.
