                        <p>Collection dates are scheduled for the 1st and 3rd Tuesdays from April through November, courtesy of the Cityâ€™s Department of Public Works, and there's no extra cost to residents.</p>
                    
                        <li>This service is for fallen branches or minor tree trimming conducted by the property owner. The City won't collect brush or branches from trees removed by a professional service.</li>
                        <li>Place brush piles neatly at the curb, ensuring they're no higher than 4 feet and all cut ends face the same direction, preferably away from the traffic flow.</li>
                        <li>This service is for large branches and limbs exceeding 4 feet in length, with the main branch stem having a minimum diameter of 1 inch and not exceeding 6 inches. (To safeguard employees, very small branches or sticks won't be collected.)</li>
                        <li>Brush contaminated with dirt, vines, stumps, stones, or metal won't be collected as it can't be chipped.</li>
