                            <h3>Why is my water bill high? Do I have a leak?</h3>
                      </div>
                            <p>Did you realize that even a tiny drip from a faucet can waste up to 207 gallons of water in a single day? Not only does this waste precious resources, but it also drains your wallet. Take a moment to inspect for leaks around your home. It's a small effort that pays off big in the long run, saving you money and conserving water. Let's put a stop to those leaks! </p>
                            <p>In Williamston, the average water pressure stands at 67lbs. per square inch. However, if it drops slightly to 65lbs., the impact can be significant. Just take a look at this table:</p>
                            <table style = "width:50%">
                             <tr>
                                <th>Size of Leak</th>
                                <th>Water wasted after 24 hours</th>
                             </tr>

                               <tr>
                                    <td>1/32” drip</td>
                                    <td>207 gallons</td>
                            </tr>

                                <tr>
                                    <td>1/16” trickle</td>
                                    <td>828 gallons</td>
                                </tr>

                                <tr>
                                    <td>1/8” stream</td>
                                    <td>1872 gallons</td>
                                </tr>
                             </table>
                             <p>Even the smallest of leaks can add up to over $575.00 on your annual water bill.</p>
                             <p>Toilet leaks can be sneaky, often caused by faulty valves, float arms, or overflow tubes. To check for leaks, simply add a few drops of food coloring to the tank and wait, preferably overnight. If you spot colored water in the bowl without flushing, you've got a leak that needs fixing.</p>
                             <p>Detecting faucet leaks is straightforward. If it's dripping or, worse, continues running after you've turned it off, it's time for repairs. Don't overlook hot water leaks either; they're costing you extra every time your hot water heater runs unnecessarily.</p>
                             <p>When it comes to showers, water dripping or running from the showerhead when it's supposed to be off likely indicates worn washers or seats that need replacing. Also, keep an eye out for leaks from the tub faucet while the shower is on. It defeats the purpose of a low-flow showerhead if water is wasted elsewhere.</p>
                             <p>Remember, the responsibility for maintaining water lines on private property lies with the property owner. While the DPW can assist by shutting off water at the curb, repairs to service lines and plumbing within homes or buildings are the owner's responsibility. If in doubt, consult a plumber to fix those leaks and save water and money.
