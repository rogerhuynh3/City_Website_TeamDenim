                            <h3>What types of property are assessed?</h3>
                        </div>

                        <p>All property can be broadly categorized into two main types: Real Property and Personal Property.</p>
                        <p>Real Property encompasses land and all fixtures permanently attached to it, along with any interests, benefits, and rights associated with owning physical real estate.</p>
                        <p>Personal Property consists of movable items that are not permanently affixed to the real estate. This category includes furniture, fixtures, machinery, equipment owned by businesses, certain public utilities, structures on leased land, and similar properties.</p>

                            <h3>What is "Assessed Value"?</h3>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            The Assessed Value of a property is set at 50% of its estimated fair market value, a determination made by the City Assessor. This value fluctuates annually in response to market changes. It's important to understand that the assessor doesn't create value but rather has the legal obligation to assess and value properties accordingly. Their role is to accurately determine the value based on market conditions and property characteristics.</p>

                            <h3>What is Proposal A?</h3>
                        </div>

                        <p>In 1994, Proposal A ushered in substantial reforms to Michigan's Property Tax System. However, it's important to note that Proposal A did not alter standard assessment practices; all real and personal property must still be assessed at 50% of its true cash value. What Proposal A did change was the introduction of a different value, known as taxable value, on which property taxes are calculated. Taxes are assessed based on taxable value, not the State Equalized Value (SEV).</p>
                        <p>Additionally, Proposal A mandates that homeowners file a Principal Residence Exemption Affidavit and a Property Transfer Affidavit. These measures were introduced to ensure proper documentation and compliance with property tax regulations.</p>

                            <h3>What is "Taxable Value"?</h3>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            Taxable value, established by the passage of Proposal A in 1994, governs property taxes. It's crucial to note that property taxes are calculated based on taxable value, not the State Equalized Value (SEV). Taxable value is determined as the lesser of the assessed value or the capped value.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class = "section">
                        <div class = "header">
                            <h3>What is "capped value"?</h3>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            The capped value of a property is determined by taking the lesser of either a +5% increase or the Consumer Price Index (CPI) applied to the prior year's taxable value. The formula used to calculate this is: (Prior year’s taxable value – losses) x (5% or CPI, whichever is lowest) + additions = capped value. This process repeats until there is a change in ownership (transfer), which triggers an "uncapping" of the property's value.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class = "section">
                        <div class = "header">
                            <h3>What is "uncapping"?</h3>
                        </div>

                        <p>When ownership of a property changes hands, the valuation undergoes an "uncapping" process. The SEV becomes the new starting point for the buyer, and the capping process restarts on the property until another ownership transfer takes place.</p>
                        <p>Starting from December 31, 2013 (PA 497 of 2012), the transfer of residential real property (whether it's a homestead or non-homestead) is exempt from uncapping under certain conditions. This exemption applies if the transferor is related by blood or affinity to the first degree and if the property's use remains unchanged after the transfer of ownership.</p>
                        <p>However, it's crucial to note that a change in use, such as converting from a principal residence to a rental property, would not be exempt from uncapping due to an ownership transfer. Relationships considered to have affinity to the first degree include spouses, parents, parents of spouses, children (including adopted children), stepchildren, step-parents, and children of spouses.</p>

                        </div>

                        <p>(Taxable value/1000 x millage rate) x 1.01 (administrative fee) = tax amount</p>

                        </div>

                        <p>Even if you and your neighbor bought your houses in different years, your taxable value would have been uncapped to match the same as the SEV. While you might believe your homes are similar, various interior and exterior attributes can influence a property's value. Factors like lot size differences, year built, condition, finished basements, decks, number of bathrooms, and more all play a role in determining property values.</p>
