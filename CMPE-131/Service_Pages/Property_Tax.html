                        <p>Ownership changes are officially recorded with the County Register of Deeds, after which copies of these deeds are provided to the assessor for record-keeping. Subsequently, the assessor forwards these updates to the treasurer. However, the treasurer receives these updates only periodically, typically a few times a year when tax bills are printed and mailed out.</p>
                        <p>For any necessary corrections related to property ownership, please contact the assessor, Pete Preston, directly at 517-655-2448.</p>

                        <p>Property taxes that remain unpaid become delinquent and are transferred to the County Treasurer on March 1. At that point, additional penalties and fees may be applied. All inquiries and payments regarding delinquent property taxes must be directed to the Ingham County Treasurer’s office. For further information, please contact the County Treasurer’s office at 517-676-7220.</p>
